Workshop Overview

In this workshop, we explored the fundamentals of statistics, covering:

1. Types of Statistics
- Descriptive Statistics
- Inferential Statistics

2. Measures of Central Tendency (Centre)
- Mean
- Median
- Mode

3. Measures of Variability (Spread)
- Range
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
  
4. Quantiles
- 25th percentile (Q1)
- 50th percentile (Q2 or Median)
- 75th percentile (Q3)

5. Interquartile Range (IQR)
- IQR = Q3 - Q1

6. Outliers
- Data points below Q1 - 1.5_IQR or above Q3 + 1.5_IQR

7. Visualizing Data
- Histogram: Understand data distribution
- Boxplot: Visualize quartiles, IQR, and outliers




Using real-world examples and interactive exercises, participants gained hands-on experience with statistical concepts.
